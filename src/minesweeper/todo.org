* Tasks
** DONE move existing code over
** DONE test existing code
** TODO finish game logic [0/2]
*** TODO redo reveal algorithm to only reveal to the nearest squares with numbers
**** - game state should be mines and numbers of neighboring mines only, not clear/uncleared
**** - will need secondary stateful object to keep track of either move sequence or revealed squares
**** - move sequence is more pure/doesn't destroy information.
**** - so the reveal state is no longer tracked in the 'game state' board, but derived from move seq every time.
*** TODO neighbor detection not working correctly
** TODO build REPL interface [0/1]
*** TODO validation and/or feedback
** TODO build web interface
